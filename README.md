# Memorabilia
Memorabilia is an augmented reality iOS app for creating virtual experiences in real world spaces that are customizable with personal media, such as photos, videos, songs and texts. The goal is to create a virtual Memory Palace in a familiar place to help users save memories with spatial relevance or to assist them with daily tasks, specially people with neurocognitive disorders.

This application was developed as a graduation project in Computer Engineering at PUC-Rio.
