# Memorabilia
Memorabilia is an augmented reality app iOS for creating virtual experiences in real world spaces that lets users customize them with personal media, such as photos, videos, songs and texts. The goal is to create a virtual Memory Palace in a familiar place to help users save memories with spatial relevance or provide guidance on daily tasks, specially for persons with neurocognitive disorders.

This application was developed as a graduation project in Computer Engineering at PUC-Rio.
